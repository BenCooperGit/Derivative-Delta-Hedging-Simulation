# Derivative-Delta-Hedging-Simulation
## This project is built to demonstrate the returns expected from implementation of discrete delta hedging.
A series of simplifying assumptions are made.  
<br/>
Underlying Asset:
* Underlying assets price follows a geometric brownian motion
* Underlying asset pays no dividends

Volatility:
* Implied Volatility from the option remains constant throughout the duration of the options life
* Volatility of the underlying remains constant throughout the options life
